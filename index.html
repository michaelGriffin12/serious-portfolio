    <H2>Michael Griffin</H2>
    <P>  My name is Michael Griffin. I do some programming, although I don't
       commonly make websites, so I had to crank out the MDN manual for this
       one.  I primarily program in C, which is an odd primary language for a
       web developer; if for some reason you <I>do</I> hire me as a web
       developer, I will probably do fine. Please note that web animations,
       like the breathing H1 tag I have at the top, takes some CPU power to
       render. My current laptop's CPU package, will consume 1.5x its idle
       power, to render it (which isn't bad). If these animations are
       <I>vibecoded</I>, than that power draw will be far more significant. You
       <I>really</I> should hire a good developer for your websites, rather
       than use AI (for non developrs).
       <A HREF="https://www.tetsuocorp.com">This website</A> is a good
       reference for how much power bad programming can waste. On my laptop,
       this website consumes 6x the package's power draw, in order to render.
       This makes my laptop in its entirety, consume 2x the power, which will
       drain the battery 2x faster.
    </P>

    <H2>Projects</H2>
      <P>  Many projects that I have worked on remain unfinished. Most of them
         are related to UNIX system calls, as well as foundational algorithms.
         I have also branched out to graphics programming somewhat, although I
         am still mediocre in this aspect.
      </P>
